## Bravi: backend

Lumen is a micro-framework from Laravel creator, and consists of a smaller, faster and leaner version of a full web application framework.

To start this project, you have two possible ways:
* [Hard mode](https://github.com/MateusTorquato/bravi-backend/tree/master/instructions/hard-mode "Hard mode"): You will have to install all dependencies, php, composer, database (MySQL, PostgreSQL or whatever you wish), and all you need to run the project in your machine.
* [Easy mode](https://github.com/MateusTorquato/bravi-backend/tree/master/instructions/easy-mode "Easy mode"): Using docker and containers already set up with php, composer, database, and whatever we need.
